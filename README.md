# HashTable_Implementation
A c++ implementation of a HashTable

Hey everyone, this is one of the projects I worked on in my Algorithm Analysis class, it's an implementation of a HashTable done in c++.
I created a template class that would be able to hash values, using a very simple hash function (mod20). It's not super usefull for people
unless they are going through a similar course and have trouble understanding the idea. Enjoy!
